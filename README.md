# Kaggle-Competitions
I've worked on some kaggle competitions. If you look at the scripts themselves, they're all ipython notebooks. I've
added some annotation so you can see my thought process as I'm working through the competitions. A lot of the 
things I'm trying don't work. I'm hoping that means I haven't been motivated enough to find the right answer. But 
everyone who's wrong hope that.

The forest cover script: I stopped working on that one because the deadline for the contest was almost open. I 
wasn't using any publicly available scripts because I didn't have internet access where I was working on it. So 
if it looks extra messy, that's why. I did beat the benchmark using only my reasoning skills and no computer 
modelling.

The eeg model: someone in that competition had gotten a score of 92% on the first day. I didn't think that there 
was much I could add to that so I stopped working on it.

The Liberty Mutual data: as of 7/9, the only thing I've managed to do is get my score to go down. Look at the 
GradientBoostingRegressor file. I've given an explanation about what the problem is with modelling the data 
sets. However, I haven't said what I'm doing to try to get a better result. Mostly because I think it might not 
work. If I find it doesn't, I'll report then.
